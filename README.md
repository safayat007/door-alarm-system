# Introduction :
Ultrasonic sensors are great tools to measure distance.Whenever somebody comes in the range of Ultrasonic sensor, a buzzer starts beeping. The detection range can be set according to our need.
# Ultrasonic Sensor Module
The HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor is a cheap ranging sensor capable of measuring a distance between 20 â€“ 400cm without contact and at an accuracy of up to 3mm. The sensor is made up of a transmitter and receiver with operating frequency of around 40khz. It uses the echo principle for distance measurement by emitting an ultrasonic wave of 40khz. If there is an object in its path, the emitted wave is reflected and the reflected signal is received via the receiver. The time elapsed between the transmission of the signal and the reception of the echo is then used to determine the distance between the sensor and an object in its path.
